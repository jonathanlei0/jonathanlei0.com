        <i>On-Demand @ Voltage Park; (Former) Harvard Student, Airline Points Collector</i>
        <br><br>
        <p>Hey, I'm Jonathan! It's great to have you here.
            <br><br>I work at <a href="https://www.voltagepark.com" target="_blank">Voltage Park</a>, one of the largest
            infrastructure clouds for AI. I lead the team that builds the UI and back-end systems that lets you spin up
            cloud GPU instances, on-demand. If you strive for perfection, if you thrive under stress, and if you are an
            innate leader—even if by example—<a href="https://calendly.com/jlei-voltagepark">let's chat</a>!
            <br><br>Before that, I started <a href="https://www.tensordock.com" target="_blank">TensorDock</a>, a cloud
            GPU marketplace that provides startups, researchers, and AI labs the industry's most affordable GPU
            infrastructure. We built the hardware, we built the hypervisor, and we built the load balancers so that
            customers don't have to. I raised $125k in institutional funding and scaled the company to 8 team members.
            <br><br>
            In my free time, I like to meet highly ambitious people regardless of traction and learn about—and perhaps
            help them with—their challenges. I scout for <a href="https://contrary.com/">Contrary</a>, and I've also written
            a few personal checks. If you're passionate about a problem and are working on an interesting solution,
            even if it's not fleshed out, shoot me an email! Would love to chat. I'm sure there's something I can learn
            from you :)
            <br><br>I'm an electrical engineering student at Harvard on leave, and I grew up in Massachusetts.
            <br><br>What's on my mind:
        <ul>
            <li>Hiring full-time engineers at Voltage Park. People with intuition, taste, ambition, vision, and skill —
                not necessarily experience. If that sounds like you, <a href="mailto:jlei@voltagepark.com">shoot me an
                    email!</a></li>
            <li>How to structure teams and build organizational hierarchy that scale while maintaining individual autonomy</li>
            <li>Building a company office and workspace in SF :)</li>
            <li>Where to (credit) my next flight!</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        That's all for now! Thanks for stopping by!
        <br>
        - Jonathan
