            <i>CS Student @ Harvard, Founder @ TensorDock, Angel Investing</i>
            <br><br>
            <p>Hey, I'm Jonathan! Whoever you are, it's great to have you here :) 
                <br><br>I'm a computer science student at Harvard. There's something magical about the scalability of technology: a single advancement can impact millions of people. That's why I'm here. I want to develop the hard 
                tech skills that I'll need to build really cool products in the future.
                <br><br>I'm also the founder of <a href="https://www.tensordock.com" target="_blank">TensorDock</a>, a marketplace that provides startups, researchers, and AI labs the industry's most affordable GPU infrastructure.
                If you strive for perfection, if you thrive under stress, and if you are an innate leader—even if by example—let’s <a href="https://www.tensordock.com/about#jobs">work together</a>. 
                <br><br>
                And, I dabble with angel investing. I've only written a few small checks so far, but I'm looking to do more. I look for highly intelligent people regardless of traction, and I invest at the earliest stages. 
                I view investing as a tool for me to meet other smart people and to learn about—and perhaps help them with—their challenges. I write personal checks, and I also scout for <a href="https://contrary.com/">Contrary</a>. <s>If you have a promising idea</s> If you're passionate about a problem and are working on something interesting, 
                even if it's not fleshed out, shoot me an email! Would love to chat; I'm sure there's something I can learn from you :) 
            <br>
            <br>
                What's on my mind:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hiring another full-time founding engineer at TensorDock. Compensation will be competitive! Just need to find the right person.</li>
                    <li>Onboarding a 32x H100 cluster complete with 3.2Tbps IB interconnect to TensorDock mid-January; that's $1m of hardware!</li>
                    <li>Figuring out how to visit Asia sometime this winter. Award availability is a bit low, and I might need another credit card's signup bonus, 
                        but I think I can finesse something.</li>
                    <li>CS61/Math22 problem sets... :cry: </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                That's all for now! Thanks for stopping by :)
                <br>
                - Jonathan
