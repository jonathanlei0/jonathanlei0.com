            <i>Harvard Student, Airline Points Collector, Amateur Investor</i>
            <br><br>
            <p>Hey, I'm Jonathan! It's great to have you here.
                <br><br>I'm a electrical engineering (or maybe CS) student at
                Harvard. I'm
                here to develop the hard
                skills that I'll need to build really cool products in the
                future as well as to meet potential future co-founders.
                <br><br>I'm an early team member at <a
                    href="https://www.tensordock.com"
                    target="_blank">TensorDock</a>, a marketplace that provides
                startups, researchers, and AI labs the industry's most
                affordable GPU infrastructure.
                We've built the hardware, we've built the hypervisor, and we've
                built the load balancers so that customers don't have to.
                If you strive for perfection, if you thrive under stress, and if
                you are an innate leader—even if by example—I can make a <a
                    href="https://www.tensordock.com/about#jobs">referral</a>.
                <br><br>
                I started in software engineering, but after it became clear
                that there were much better developers than me, I pivoted to
                finance and strategy. I think my true passion might be technical
                sales, so I'm now figuring out how to make myself redundant so I
                can focus on that. The business has grown so much since I
                started here, and I'm excited to see where it goes next. It's
                been a huge learning journey.
                <br><br>
                And, I dabble with angel investing. I've only written a few
                tiny checks so far, but I'm looking to do more. I look for
                highly intelligent people regardless of
                traction, and I invest at the earliest stages.
                I view investing as a tool for me to meet cool people and to
                learn about—or perhaps help them with—their challenges. I write
                personal checks, and I also scout for <a
                    href="https://contrary.com/">Contrary</a>. <s>If you have a
                    "billion dollar" idea</s> If you're passionate about a
                problem and are working on an interesting solution,
                even if it's not fleshed out, shoot me an email! Would love to
                chat. I'm sure there's something I can learn from you :)
                <br>
                <br>
                What's on my mind:
                <ul>
                    <li>Helping hire another full-time founding engineer at
                        TensorDock. Someone with intuition, taste, ambition,
                        vision, and skill — not necessarily experience. If that
                        sounds like you, let's chat!</li>
                    <li>How to structure teams and build organizational
                        hierarchy
                        that scales long-term</li>
                    <li>Figuring out how to run a company house this summer in
                        SF :)</li>
                    <li>How to maximize a shit ton of credit card spend
                        :stuck_out_tongue:</li>
                    <li>Where to travel next!</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                That's all for now! Thanks for stopping by!
