            <h1>Jonathan Lei</h1>
            <i>CS Student @ Harvard, Founder @ TensorDock, Amateur Angel Investor</i>
            <br><br>
            <p>Hey, I'm Jonathan! It's great to have you here.
                <br><br>I'm a computer science student at Harvard. I'm here to develop the hard 
                skills that I'll need to build really cool products in the future as well as to meet potential future co-founders.
                <br><br>I'm also the founder of <a href="https://www.tensordock.com" target="_blank">TensorDock</a>, a marketplace that provides startups, researchers, and AI labs the industry's most affordable GPU infrastructure. 
                We've built the hardware, we've built the hypervisor, and we've built the load balancers so that customers don't have to. 
                If you strive for perfection, if you thrive under stress, and if you are an innate leader—even if by example—let’s <a href="https://www.tensordock.com/about#jobs">work together</a>. 
                <br><br>
                And, I dabble with angel investing. I've only written a few small checks so far, but I'm looking to do more. I look for highly intelligent people regardless of traction, and I invest at the earliest stages. 
                I view investing as a tool for me to meet cool people and to learn about—or perhaps help them with—their challenges. I write personal checks, and I also scout for <a href="https://contrary.com/">Contrary</a>. <s>If you have a "billion dollar" idea</s> If you're passionate about a problem and are working on an interesting solution, 
                even if it's not fleshed out, shoot me an email! Would love to chat. I'm sure there's something I can learn from you :) 
            <br>
            <br>
                What's on my mind:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hiring another full-time founding engineer at TensorDock. Someone with intuition, taste, ambition, vision, and skill, not necessarily experience. If that sounds like you, let's chat!</li>
                    <li>Onboarding an H100 cluster interconnected by 3.2Tbps IB to TensorDock mid-January. Each system: 8x H100 80GB SXMs, 1TB DDR5 RAM, etc etc... a 7-figure hardware deployment!</li>
                    <li>Figuring out how to visit Asia sometime this winter. Award availability is a bit low, and I might need another credit card's signup bonus, 
                        but I think I can finesse something.</li>
                    <li>CS61/Math22 problem sets... :cry: </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                That's all for now! Thanks for stopping by!
                <br>
